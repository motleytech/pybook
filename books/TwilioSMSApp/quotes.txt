        Quite often, as life goes on, when we feel completely secure as we go on our way, we suddenly notice that we are trapped in error, that we have allowed ourselves to be taken in by iniduals, by objects, have dreamt up an affinity with them which immediately vanishes before our waking eye; and yet we cannot tear ourselves away, held fast by some power that seems incomprehensible to us. Sometimes, however, we become fully aware and realize that error as well as truth can move and spur us on to action. Now because action is always a decisive factor, something really good can result from an active error, because the effect of all that has been done reaches out into infinity. So although creative action is certainly always best, destroying what has been done is also not without happy consequence.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Harold Nicolson<blockquote>

        Boredom will always remain the greatest enemy of school disciplines. If we remember that children are bored, not only when they don't happen to be interested in the subject or when the teacher doesn't make it interesting, but also when certain working conditions are out of focus with their basic needs, then we can realize what a great contributor to discipline problems boredom really is. Research has shown that boredom is closely related to frustration and that the effect of too much frustration is invariably irritability, withdrawal, rebellious opposition or aggressive rejection of the whole show. <br>

One must live in the middle of contradiction, because if all contradiction were eliminated at once life would collapse. There are simply no answers to some of the great pressing questions.

        I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Vince Lombardi<blockquote>

        Now my friends, I am opposed to the system of society in which we live today, not because I lack the natural equipment to do for myself but because I am not satisfied to make myself comfortable knowing that there are thousands of my fellow men who suffer for the barest necessities of life. We were taught under the old ethic that man's business on this earth was to look out for himself. That was the ethic of the jungle; the ethic of the wild beast. Take care of yourself, no matter what may become of your fellow man. Thousands of years ago the question was asked; ''Am I my brother's keeper?'' That question has never yet been answered in a way that is satisfactory to civilized society.

Yes, I am my brother's keeper. I am under a moral obligation to him that is inspired, not by any maudlin sentimentality but by the higher duty I owe myself.

        American liberals and conservatives share much of the same political heritage. Originally the term Liberal referred to the political and economic ideal of liberating iniduals from unrepresentative and arbitrary governments. Early liberalism set in motion patterns for the rule of law that would guarantee inidual rights, representation in law making, access to the courts, and protection of private property. Both conservatives and liberals are Liberal in this sense. But whereas American conservatives of various stripes have continued to place primary emphasis on inidual freedom, the autonomy of private institutions, and limits to government in the economic area, American liberals have more frequently appealed to government to advance the liberation of iniduals from economic, racial, and political disadvantages in society as a whole.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>John Kenneth Galbraith<blockquote>

        Most liberals never lost sight of the potential for evil in big government. They have consistently opposed government power in matters of personal and political belief. Liberals are not unconcerned with economic liberty, but they have come to believe that the common good requires that social justice be given a higher priority than absolute economic freedom. Conservatives are—and always have been—on the other side of both questions. They are much more prone than liberals to limiting personal and political liberties, but they place the freedom of an inidual to do as he pleases in the economic realm at the top of their concerns. Social justice has held a lower priority for conservatives, from the days of Alexander Hamilton when they favored strong government as a means of protecting their economic privileges to the days of Ronald Reagan when they see government as an instrument of social justice and therefore a threat to their economic position.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Tom DeLay<blockquote>

        The innermost meaning of sacrifice is the annihilation of the finite just because it is finite. In order to demonstrate that this is the only purpose, the most noble and beautiful must be chosen; above all, man, the fulfillment of the earth. Human sacrifices are the most natural sacrifices. Man, however, is more than the fulfillment of the earth; he is reasonable, and reason is free and nothing but an eternal self-determination toward the infinite. Thus man can sacrifice only himself, and that is what he does in the omnipresent sanctissimum of which the masses are not aware. All artists are self-sacrificing human beings, and to become an artist is nothing but to devote oneself to the subterranean gods. The meaning of ine creation is primarily revealed in the enthusiasm of annihilation.

        I look forward confidently to the day when all who work for a living will be one with no thought to their separateness as Negroes, Jews, Italians or any other distinctions. This will be the day when we bring into full realization the American dream -- a dream yet unfulfilled. A dream of equality of opportunity, of privilege and property widely distributed; a dream of a land where men will not take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few; a dream of a land where men will not argue that the color of a man's skin determines the content of his character; a dream of a nation where all our gifts and resources are held not for ourselves alone, but as instruments of service for the rest of humanity; the dream of a country where every man will respect the dignity and worth of the human personality.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Martin Luther King, jr.<blockquote>

Debs<blockquote>
        Now my friends, I am opposed to the system of society in which we live today, not because I lack the natural equipment to do for myself but because I am not satisfied to make myself comfortable knowing that there are thousands of my fellow men who suffer for the barest necessities of life. We were taught under the old ethic that man's business on this earth was to look out for himself. That was the ethic of the jungle; the ethic of the wild beast. Take care of yourself, no matter what may become of your fellow man. Thousands of years ago the question was asked; ''Am I my brother's keeper?'' That question has never yet been answered in a way that is satisfactory to civilized society.

Yes, I am my brother's keeper. I am under a moral obligation to him that is inspired, not by any maudlin sentimentality but by the higher duty I owe myself. What would you think me if I were capable of seating myself at a table and gorging myself with food and saw about me the children of my fellow beings starving to death.<blockquote>1908 speech</blockquote><##QUOTE##>George Bernard Shaw<blockquote>

        The leaders who work most effectively, it seems to me, never say "I." And that's not because they have trained themselves not to say "I." They don't think "I."

This is what creates trust, what enables you to get the task done.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>
        What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.

        Boredom will always remain the greatest enemy of school disciplines. If we remember that children are bored, not only when they don't happen to be interested in the subject or when the teacher doesn't make it interesting, but also when certain working conditions are out of focus with their basic needs, then we can realize what a great contributor to discipline problems boredom really is. Research has shown that boredom is closely related to frustration and that the effect of too much frustration is invariably irritability, withdrawal, rebellious opposition or aggressive rejection of the whole show. <br>

        If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude. See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for. The college, which should be a place of delightful labour, is made odious and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits. I would have the studies elective. Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge. The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself. The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

        To enjoy freedom, if the platitude is pardonable, we have of course to control ourselves.

One must live in the middle of contradiction, because if all contradiction were eliminated at once life would collapse. There are simply no answers to some of the great pressing questions.

        Faith is not contrary to the usual ideas, something that turns out to be right or wrong, like a gambler's bet: it's an act, an intention, a project, something that makes you, in leaping into the future, go so far, far, far ahead that you shoot clean out of time and right into Eternity, which is not theend of time or a whole lot of time or unending time, but timelessness, the old Eternal Now.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>John A.

        American families have always shown remarkable resiliency, or flexible adjustment to natural, economic, and social challenges.  Their strengths resemble the elasticity of a spider web, a gull's skillful flow with the wind, the regenerating power of perennial grasses, the cooperation of an ant colony, and the persistence of a stream carving canyon rocks. These are not the strengths of fixed monuments but living organisms. This resilience is not measured by wealth, muscle or efficiency but by creativity, unity, and hope. Cultivating these family strengths is critical to a thriving human community.<blockquote>Family Life Specialist with the University of Wyoming's Cooperative Extension Service</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Bertrand Russell<blockquote>

        The remarkable thing is that we really love our neighbor as ourselves: we do unto others as we do unto ourselves. We hate others when we hate ourselves.

        There are two visions of America. One precedes our founding fathers and finds its roots in the harshness of our puritan past. It is very suspicious of freedom, uncomfortable with ersity, hostile to science, unfriendly to reason, contemptuous of personal autonomy. It sees America as a religious nation. It views patriotism as allegiance to God. It secretly adores coercion and conformity. Despite our constitution, despite the legacy of the Enlightenment, it appeals to millions of Americans and threatens our freedom.

The other vision finds its roots in the spirit of our founding revolution and in the leaders of this nation who embraced the age of reason. It loves freedom, encourages ersity, embraces science and affirms the dignity and rights of every inidual. It sees America as a moral nation, neither completely religious nor completely secular. It defines patriotism as love of country and of the people who make it strong. It defends all citizens against unjust coercion and irrational conformity.

This second vision is our vision. It is the vision of a free society. We must be bold enough to proclaim it and strong enough to defend it against all its enemies.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Alex Carey<blockquote>

        The inventor of their heaven empties into it all the nations of the earth, in one common jumble. All are on an equality absolute, no one of them ranking another; they have to be "brothers"; they have to mix together, pray together, harp together, hosannah together--whites, niggers, Jews, everybody--there's no distinction. Here in the earth all nations hate each other, and every one of them hates the Jew. Yet every pious person adores that heaven and wants to get into it. He really does. And when he is in a holy rapture he thinks he thinks that if he were only there he would take all the populace to his heart, and hug, and hug, and hug! <blockquote><i>Letters from the Earth</i></blockquote><##QUOTE##>Thomas Paine<blockquote>

Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others' activities.  For this reason it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others.<br>

When you bring up arguments that cast serious doubts on their cherished beliefs you are not simply making a rhetorical point, you are threatening their whole Universe and their immortality.

        Now my friends, I am opposed to the system of society in which we live today, not because I lack the natural equipment to do for myself but because I am not satisfied to make myself comfortable knowing that there are thousands of my fellow men who suffer for the barest necessities of life. We were taught under the old ethic that man's business on this earth was to look out for himself. That was the ethic of the jungle; the ethic of the wild beast. Take care of yourself, no matter what may become of your fellow man. Thousands of years ago the question was asked; ''Am I my brother's keeper?'' That question has never yet been answered in a way that is satisfactory to civilized society.

Yes, I am my brother's keeper. I am under a moral obligation to him that is inspired, not by any maudlin sentimentality but by the higher duty I owe myself.

Two different theories exist concerning the origin of children: the theory of Sexual reproduction, and the theory of the stork.

In reality, however, many of the world's leading scientists are in favor of the theory of the stork. If the theory of sexual reproduction is taught in schools, it must only be taught as a theory and not as the truth. Alternative theories, such as the theory of the stork, must also be taught.<br>

        Three passions have governed my life: <br>
The longings for love, the search for knowledge, <br>

In the union of love I have seen <br>
In a mystic miniature the prefiguring vision <br>
Of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined. 

With equal passion I have sought knowledge. <br>
I have wished to understand the hearts of [people]. <br>
I have wished to know why the stars shine. 

Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens, <br>
But always pity brought me back to earth; <br>
Cries of pain reverberated in my heart <br>
Of children in famine, of victims tortured <br>
And of old people left helpless. <br>
I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, <br>
And I too suffer.

        Now my friends, I am opposed to the system of society in which we live today, not because I lack the natural equipment to do for myself but because I am not satisfied to make myself comfortable knowing that there are thousands of my fellow men who suffer for the barest necessities of life. We were taught under the old ethic that man's business on this earth was to look out for himself. That was the ethic of the jungle; the ethic of the wild beast. Take care of yourself, no matter what may become of your fellow man. Thousands of years ago the question was asked; ''Am I my brother's keeper?'' That question has never yet been answered in a way that is satisfactory to civilized society.

Yes, I am my brother's keeper. I am under a moral obligation to him that is inspired, not by any maudlin sentimentality but by the higher duty I owe myself. What would you think me if I were capable of seating myself at a table and gorging myself with food and saw about me the children of my fellow beings starving to death.<blockquote>1908 speech</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Eugene V.

        First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Eugene V. Debs<blockquote>
        Now my friends, I am opposed to the system of society in which we live today, not because I lack the natural equipment to do for myself but because I am not satisfied to make myself comfortable knowing that there are thousands of my fellow men who suffer for the barest necessities of life. We were taught under the old ethic that man's business on this earth was to look out for himself. That was the ethic of the jungle; the ethic of the wild beast. Take care of yourself, no matter what may become of your fellow man. Thousands of years ago the question was asked; ''Am I my brother's keeper?'' That question has never yet been answered in a way that is satisfactory to civilized society.

Yes, I am my brother's keeper. I am under a moral obligation to him that is inspired, not by any maudlin sentimentality but by the higher duty I owe myself. What would you think me if I were capable of seating myself at a table and gorging myself with food and saw about me the children of my fellow beings starving to death.<blockquote>1908 speech</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Felix Adler<blockquote>
        The conception of worth, that each person is an end per se, is not a mere abstraction. Our interest in it is not merely academic. Every outcry against the oppression of some people by other people, or against what is morally hideous is the affirmation of the principle that a human being as such is not to be violated. A human being is not to be handled as a tool but is to be respected and revered. <BLOCKQUOTE><I>The Ethical Philosophy of Life</I></BLOCKQUOTE><##QUOTE##>Franklin Thomas<blockquote>
        One day our descendants will think it incredible that we paid so much attention to things like the amount of melanin in our skin or the shape of our eyes or our gender instead of the unique identities of each of us as complex human beings. <BLOCKQUOTE><I>in Gloria Steinem, Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions, 1983</I></BLOCKQUOTE><##QUOTE##>G.

        Responsibility does not only lie with the leaders of our countries or with those who have been appointed or elected to do a particular job.  It lies with each of us inidually.  Peace, for example, starts within each one of us.  When we have inner peace, we can be at peace with those around us.<br>

        Your body needs to be held and to hold, to be touched and to touch. None of these needs is to be despised, denied, or repressed. But you have to keep searching for your body's deeper need, the need for genuine love. Every time you are able to go beyond the body's superficial desires for love, you are bringing your body home and moving toward integration and unity.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Henry David Thoreau<blockquote>
        If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Holocaust Museum, Washington, DC<blockquote>

        The whole course of human history may depend on a change of heart in one solitary and even humble inidual - for it is in the solitary mind and soul of the inidual that the battle between good and evil is waged and ultimately won or lost.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>M. Scott Peck<blockquote>
        Although the act of nurturing another's spiritual growth has the effect of nurturing one's own, a major characteristic of genuine love is that the distinction between oneself and the other is always maintained and preserved.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Margaret Chase Smith<blockquote>
        Moral cowardice that keeps us from speaking our minds is as dangerous to this country as irresponsible talk. The right way is not always the popular and easy way. Standing for right when it is unpopular is a true test of moral character.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Martin Buber<blockquote>
        A person cannot approach the ine by reaching beyond the human. To become human, is what this inidual person, has been created for.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Martin Luther King, Jr.<blockquote>
        An inidual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his inidualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Martin Luther King, Jr.<blockquote>
        I look forward confidently to the day when all who work for a living will be one with no thought to their separateness as Negroes, Jews, Italians or any other distinctions. This will be the day when we bring into full realization the American dream -- a dream yet unfulfilled. A dream of equality of opportunity, of privilege and property widely distributed; a dream of a land where men will not take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few; a dream of a land where men will not argue that the color of a man's skin determines the content of his character; a dream of a nation where all our gifts and resources are held not for ourselves alone, but as instruments of service for the rest of humanity; the dream of a country where every man will respect the dignity and worth of the human personality.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Martin Luther King, Jr.<blockquote>

        It is one thing to decry the rat race...that is the good and honorable work of moralists. It is quite another thing to quit the rat race, to drop out, to refuse to run any further -- that is the work of the inidualist. It is offensive because it is impolite; it makes the rebuke personal; the inidualist calls not his or her behavior into question, but mine. <br>

        What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.  It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it.  It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great person is one who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>
        Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous, half possession.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

        A person will worship something, have no doubt about that.  We may think our tribute is paid in secret in the dark recesses of our hearts, but it will out.  That which dominates our imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives, and our character.  Therefore, it behooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are worshipping we are becoming.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>
        What a man does, that he has. What has he to do with hope or fear? In himself is his might. Let him regard no good as solid but that which is in his nature, and which must grow out of him as long as he exists. The goods of fortune may come and go like summer leaves; let him scatter them on every wind as the momentary signs of his infinite productiveness.<blockquote><i>from "Spiritual Laws"</i></blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

        Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>
        There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better for worse as his portion . . . It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>
        Be as beneficent as the sun or the sea, but if your rights as a rational being are trenched on, die on the first inch of your territory.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>
        When I go into the garden with a spade, and dig a bed, I feel such an exhilaration and health that I discover that I have been defrauding myself all this time in letting others do for me what I should have done with my own hands.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

        Conservatism stands on man's confessed limitations; reform on his indisputable infinitude; conservatism on circumstance; liberalism on power; one goes to make an adroit member of the social frame; the other to postpone all things to the man himself; conservatism is debonnair and social; reform is inidual and imperious.<br>

        People spend a lifetime searching for happiness; looking for peace. They chase idle dreams, addictions, religions, even other people, hoping to fill the emptiness that plagues them.

        To go against the dominant thinking of your friends, of most of the people you see every day, is perhaps the most difficult act of heroism you can perform.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Theodore Roosevelt<blockquote>
        It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.<blockquote><i>From a speech given in Paris at the Sorbonne in 1910</i></blockquote><##QUOTE##>Vanessa Redgrave<blockquote>

        If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, they increase the load that is laid upon it, for thereby the parts are joined more firmly together.

        Over the years I have developed a picture of what a human being living humanely is like. She is a person who understand, values and develops her body, finding it beautiful and useful; a person who is real and is willing to take risks, to be creative, to manifest competence, to change when the situation calls for it, and to find ways to accommodate to what is new and different, keeping that part of the old that is still useful and discarding what is not.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Virginia Woolfe<blockquote>

        No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>William Ellery Channing<blockquote>
        I do not look on a human being as a machine, made to be kept in action by a foreign force, to accomplish an unvarying succession of motions, to do a fixed amount of work, and then to fall to pieces at death, but as a being of free spiritual powers; and I place little value on any culture but that which aims to bring out these, and to give them perpetual impulse and expansion.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>William Ellery Channing<blockquote>
        I have expressed my strong interest in the mass of the people; and this is founded, not on their usefulness to the community, so much as on what they are in themselves....  Indeed every man (sic), in every condition, is great.  It is only our own diseased sight which makes him little.  A man is great as a man, be he where or what he may.

        If you were all alone in the universe with no one to talk to, no one with which to share the beauty of the stars, to laugh with, to touch, what would be your purpose in life?

        There is no beautifier of complexion, or form, or behavior, like the wish to scatter joy and not pain around us. 'Tis good to give a stranger a meal, or a night's lodging.

        The great teachings unanimously emphasize that all the peace, wisdom, and joy in the universe are already within us; we don't have to gain, develop, or attain them. We're like a child standing in a beautiful park with his eyes shut tight.

A dream of equality of opportunity, of privilege and property widely distributed; a dream of a land where men will not take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few; a dream of a land where men will not argue that the color of a man's skin determines the content of his character; a dream of a nation where all our gifts and resources are held not for ourselves alone, but as instruments of service for the rest of humanity; the dream of a country where every man will respect the dignity and worth of the human personality.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Martin Luther King, Jr.<blockquote>

        Three passions have governed my life: <br>
The longings for love, the search for knowledge, <br>
And unbearable pity for the suffering of [humankind]. 

Love brings ecstasy and relieves loneliness. <br>
In the union of love I have seen <br>
In a mystic miniature the prefiguring vision <br>
Of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined. 

With equal passion I have sought knowledge. <br>
I have wished to understand the hearts of [people]. <br>
I have wished to know why the stars shine. 

Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens, <br>
But always pity brought me back to earth; <br>
Cries of pain reverberated in my heart <br>
Of children in famine, of victims tortured <br>
And of old people left helpless. <br>
I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, <br>
And I too suffer. 

This has been my life; I found it worth living. <BLOCKQUOTE><I>adapted</I></BLOCKQUOTE><##QUOTE##>Blaise Pascal<blockquote>

They believe that the poor and ignorant are victims of an unfair system and that their circumstances can be improved if we give them help. Republicans (I think to myself) are conservatives who think it would be best if we faced the fact that people are no damned good. They think that if we admit that we have selfish, acquisitive natures and then set out to get all we can for ourselves by working hard for it, that things will be better for everyone.

        American liberals and conservatives share much of the same political heritage. Originally the term Liberal referred to the political and economic ideal of liberating iniduals from unrepresentative and arbitrary governments. Early liberalism set in motion patterns for the rule of law that would guarantee inidual rights, representation in law making, access to the courts, and protection of private property. Both conservatives and liberals are Liberal in this sense. But whereas American conservatives of various stripes have continued to place primary emphasis on inidual freedom, the autonomy of private institutions, and limits to government in the economic area, American liberals have more frequently appealed to government to advance the liberation of iniduals from economic, racial, and political disadvantages in society as a whole.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Jimmy Carter<blockquote>

        Change can take place only when liberal and radical pressures are both strong. Intelligent liberals have always recognized the debt they owe to radicals, whose existence permits liberals to push further than they would otherwise have dared, all the while posing as compromisers and mediators. Radicals, however, have been somewhat less sensible of their debt to liberals, partly because of the rather single-minded discipline radicals are almost forced to maintain, plagued as they always are by liberal backsliding and timidity on the one hand and various forms of self-destructiveness and romantic posing on the other.... Liberal reforms and radical change are thus complementary rather than antagonistic. Together they make it possible continually to test the limits of what can be done. Liberals never know whether the door is unlocked because they are afraid to try it. Radicals, on the other hand, miss many opportunities for small advances because they are unwilling to settle for so little.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

        Most liberals never lost sight of the potential for evil in big government. They have consistently opposed government power in matters of personal and political belief. Liberals are not unconcerned with economic liberty, but they have come to believe that the common good requires that social justice be given a higher priority than absolute economic freedom. Conservatives are—and always have been—on the other side of both questions. They are much more prone than liberals to limiting personal and political liberties, but they place the freedom of an inidual to do as he pleases in the economic realm at the top of their concerns. Social justice has held a lower priority for conservatives, from the days of Alexander Hamilton when they favored strong government as a means of protecting their economic privileges to the days of Ronald Reagan when they see government as an instrument of social justice and therefore a threat to their economic position.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Wendy Kaminer<blockquote>

In the union of love I have seen <br>

Of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined. 

With equal passion I have sought knowledge. <br>
I have wished to understand the hearts of [people]. <br>
I have wished to know why the stars shine.

But always pity brought me back to earth; <br>
Cries of pain reverberated in my heart <br>
Of children in famine, of victims tortured <br>
And of old people left helpless. <br>
I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, <br>
And I too suffer.

        You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing. I wove my webs for you because I liked you. After all, what's a life, anyway? We're born, we live a little while, we die. A spider's life can't help being something of a mess, with all this trapping and eating flies. By helping you, perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle.

Cursed is the man who has found some other man's work and cannot lose it. When we talk about the great workers of the world we really mean the great players of the world. The fellows who groan and sweat under the weary load of toil that they bear never can hope to do anything great.

        If I had my life to live over, I'd dare to make more mistakes next time. I'd relax; I'd limber up. I would be sillier than I have been this trip. I would take fewer things seriously. I would take more chances. I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers. I would eat more ice cream and less beans. I would perhaps have more actual troubles, but I'd have fewer imaginary ones. 

You see, I'm one of those people who lived sensibly and sanely hour after hour, day after day. Oh, I had my moments, and if I had to do it over again, I'd have more of them. In fact, I'd try to have nothing else. Just moments, one after the other, instead of living so many years ahead of each day. I've been one of those persons who never goes anywhere without a thermometer, a hot water bottle, a raincoat, and a parachute. If I had it to do over again, I would travel lighter than I have. 

If I had my life to live over again, I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall. I would go to more dance; I would ride more merry-go-rounds. I would pick more daisies.

        When My Mind is Still

When my mind is still and alone with the beating of my heart,<br>
I remember things too easily forgotten:<br>
The purity of early love,<br>
The maturity of unselfish love that asks -- <br>
desires -- nothing but another's good,<br>
The idealism that has persisted through all the tempest of life.

When my mind is still and alone with the beating of my heart,<br>
I can find a quiet assurance, an inner peace, in the core of my being.<br>
It can face the doubt, the loneliness, the anxiety,<br>
Can accept these harsh realities and can even grow<br>
Because of these challenges to my essential being.

When my mind is still and alone with the beating of my heart,<br>
I can sense my basic humanity,<br>
And then I know that all men and women are my brothers and sisters.<br>
Nothing but my own fear and distrust can separate me from the love of friends.<br>
If I can trust others, accept them, enjoy them,<br>
Then my life shall surely be richer and more full.<br>
If I can accept others, this will help them to be more truly themselves,<br>
And they will be more able to accept me.

When my mind is still and alone with the beating of my heart,<br>
I know how much life has given me:<br>
The history of the race, friends and family,<br>
The opportunity to work, the chance to build myself.<br>
Then wells within me the urge to live more abundantly,<br>
With greater trust and joy,<br>
With more profound seriousness and earnest service,<br>
And yet more calmly at the heart of life.

        Three passions have governed my life: <br>
The longings for love, the search for knowledge, <br>
And unbearable pity for the suffering of [humankind]. 

Love brings ecstasy and relieves loneliness. <br>
In the union of love I have seen <br>
In a mystic miniature the prefiguring vision <br>
Of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined. 

With equal passion I have sought knowledge. <br>
I have wished to understand the hearts of [people]. <br>
I have wished to know why the stars shine. 

Love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens, <br>
But always pity brought me back to earth; <br>
Cries of pain reverberated in my heart <br>
Of children in famine, of victims tortured <br>
And of old people left helpless. <br>
I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, <br>
And I too suffer. 

This has been my life; I found it worth living. <BLOCKQUOTE><I>adapted</I></BLOCKQUOTE><##QUOTE##>Bible<blockquote>

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.<br>

Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.<br>

Love will not be constrained by mastery; when mastery comes, the God of love at once beats his wings, and farewell --  he is gone.  Love is a thing as free as any spirit; women naturally desire liberty, and not to be constrained like slaves; and so do men, if I shall tell the truth.<br>

        Free love? As if love is anything but free! Man has bought brains, but all the millions in the world have failed to buy love. Man has subdued bodies, but all the power on earth has been unable to subdue love. Man has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not conquer love. Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has been utterly helpless before love. High on a throne, with all the splendor and pomp his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate, if love passes him by. And if it stays, the poorest hovel is radiant with warmth, with life and color. Thus love has the magic power to make of a beggar a king. Yes, love is free; it can dwell in no other atmosphere.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Erich Fromm<blockquote>

        The friendship between a man and a woman which does not lead to marriage or desire for marriage may be a life long experience of the greatest value to themselves and to all their circle of acquaintance and of activity; but for this type of friendship both a rare man and a rare woman are needed. Perhaps it should be added that either the man or the woman thus deeply bound in lifelong friendship who seeks marriage must find a still rarer man or woman to wed, to make such a three cornered comradeship a permanent success.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Betty Friedan<blockquote>

        The very problem of mind and body suggests ision; I do not know of anything so disastrously affected by the habit of ision as this particular theme. In its discussion are reflected the splitting off from each other of religion, morals and science; the orce of philosophy from science and of both from the arts of conduct. The evils which we suffer in education, in religion, in the materialism of business and the aloofness of "intellectuals" from life, in the whole separation of knowledge and practice -- all testify to the necessity of seeing mind-body as an integral whole.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>John Milton<blockquote>

        It is, therefore, a mistake to regard myth as an inferior mode of thought, which can be cast aside when human beings have attained the age of reason. Mythology is not an early attempt at history, and does not claim that its tales are objective fact. Like a novel, an opera or a ballet, myth is make-believe; it is a game that transfigures our fragmented, tragic world, and helps us to glimpse new possibilities by asking 'what if?' â€“ a question which has also provoked some of our most important discoveries in philosoÂ­phy, science and technology.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Marlene Dietrich<blockquote>

        Today the network of relationships linking the human race to itself and to the rest of the biosphere is so complex that all aspects affect all others to an extraordinary degree.

I heard a thousand blended notes  <br>

In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts  <br>
Bring sad thoughts to the mind.  <br>
  <br>
To her fair works did Nature link<br>
The human soul that through me ran;  <br>
And much it grieved my heart to think  <br>
What Man has made of Man.<br>

        Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is easy.  All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

        There are two visions of America. One precedes our founding fathers and finds its roots in the harshness of our puritan past. It is very suspicious of freedom, uncomfortable with ersity, hostile to science, unfriendly to reason, contemptuous of personal autonomy. It sees America as a religious nation. It views patriotism as allegiance to God. It secretly adores coercion and conformity. Despite our constitution, despite the legacy of the Enlightenment, it appeals to millions of Americans and threatens our freedom.

The other vision finds its roots in the spirit of our founding revolution and in the leaders of this nation who embraced the age of reason. It loves freedom, encourages ersity, embraces science and affirms the dignity and rights of every inidual. It sees America as a moral nation, neither completely religious nor completely secular. It defines patriotism as love of country and of the people who make it strong. It defends all citizens against unjust coercion and irrational conformity.

This second vision is our vision. It is the vision of a free society. We must be bold enough to proclaim it and strong enough to defend it against all its enemies.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Ralph Waldo Emerson<blockquote>

        Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Sydney J. Harris<blockquote>
        Patriotism is proud of a country's virtues and eager to correct its deficiencies; it also acknowledges the legitimate patriotism of other countries, with their own specific virtues. The pride of nationalism, however, trumpets its country's virtues and denies its deficiencies, while it is contemptuous toward the virtues of other countries.

        There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet the enemy.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>HH the Dalai Lama<blockquote>
        Peace, in the sense of the absence of war, is of little value to someone who is dying of hunger or cold.  It will not remove the pain of torture inflicted on a prisoner of conscience.  It does not comfort those who have lost their loved ones in floods caused by senseless deforestation in a neighboring country.  Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where the people are fed, and where iniduals and nations are free.<br>

        I heard the bells on Christmas day <br>
Their old familiar carols play <br>
And mild and sweet the words repeat, <br>
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 

 I thought how as the day had come, <br>
The belfries of all Christendom <br>
Had roll'd along th' unbroken song <br>
Of peace on earth, good will to men. 

And in despair I bow'd my head: <br>
"There is no peace on earth," I said, <br>
"For hate is strong, and mocks the song <br>
Of peace on earth, good will to men."<br>

        Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is easy.  All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Carl Jung<blockquote>

We are talking about a society in which there will be no roles other than those chosen or those earned. We are really talking about humanism.<br>

        Change can take place only when liberal and radical pressures are both strong. Intelligent liberals have always recognized the debt they owe to radicals, whose existence permits liberals to push further than they would otherwise have dared, all the while posing as compromisers and mediators. Radicals, however, have been somewhat less sensible of their debt to liberals, partly because of the rather single-minded discipline radicals are almost forced to maintain, plagued as they always are by liberal backsliding and timidity on the one hand and various forms of self-destructiveness and romantic posing on the other.... Liberal reforms and radical change are thus complementary rather than antagonistic. Together they make it possible continually to test the limits of what can be done. Liberals never know whether the door is unlocked because they are afraid to try it. Radicals, on the other hand, miss many opportunities for small advances because they are unwilling to settle for so little.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>William Lloyd Garrison<blockquote>

        To understand reality is not the same as to know about outward events. It is to perceive the essential nature of things. The best-informed man is not necessarily the wisest. Indeed there is a danger that precisely in the multiplicity of his knowledge he will lose sight of what is essential. But on the other hand, knowledge of an apparently trivial detail quite often makes it possible to see into the depth of things. And so the wise man will seek to acquire the best possible knowledge about events, but always without becoming dependent upon this knowledge.

        The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes the middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy (science); for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and disgested. Therefore, from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never been made), much may be hoped.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Galileo Galilei<blockquote>

        The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God.

        In conclusion, there is a marvelous anecdote from the occasion of Russell's ninetieth birthday that best serves to summarize his attitude toward God and religion. A London lady sat next to him at this party, and over the soup she suggested to him that he was not only the world's most famous atheist but, by this time, very probably the world's oldest atheist. "What will you do, Bertie, if it turns out you're wrong?" she asked. "I mean, what if -- uh -- when the time comes, you should meet Him? What will you say?" Russell was delighted with the question. His bright, birdlike eyes grew even brighter as he contemplated this possible future dialogue, and then he pointed a finger upward and cried, "Why, I should say, 'God, you gave us insufficient evidence.'" <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Al Seckel, in Preface to Bertrand Russell on God and Religion</I></BLOCKQUOTE><##QUOTE##>Bill Cosby<blockquote>

        Everybody prays whether [you think] of it as praying or not.  The odd silence you fall into when something very beautiful is happening or something very good or very bad.

The stammer of joy at somebody else's joy.  Whatever words or sounds you use for sighing with over your own life.  These are all prayers in their way.  These are all spoken not just to yourself but to something even more familiar than yourself and even more strange than the world.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Friedrich Schleiermacher<blockquote>

        The common dogma [of fundamentalists] is fear of modern knowledge, inability to cope with the fast change in a scientific-technological society, and the real breakdown in apparent moral order in recent years.... That is why hate is the major fuel, fear is the cement of the movement, and superstitious ignorance is the best defense against the dangerous new knowledge. ... When you bring up arguments that cast serious doubts on their cherished beliefs you are not simply making a rhetorical point, you are threatening their whole Universe and their immortality. That provokes anger and quite frequently violence. ... Unfortunately you cannot reason with them and you even risk violence in confronting them.

        Religious suffering is at one and the same time the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.

The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Louisa May Alcott<blockquote>
        Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death.

        All schools, all colleges, have two great functions: to confer, and to conceal, valuable knowledge.

        In religion and politics people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners, whose opinions about them were not worth a brass farthing. <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Autobiography, 1959</I></BLOCKQUOTE><##QUOTE##>Matthew Arnold<blockquote>

        There are two visions of America. One precedes our founding fathers and finds its roots in the harshness of our puritan past. It is very suspicious of freedom, uncomfortable with ersity, hostile to science, unfriendly to reason, contemptuous of personal autonomy. It sees America as a religious nation. It views patriotism as allegiance to God. It secretly adores coercion and conformity. Despite our constitution, despite the legacy of the Enlightenment, it appeals to millions of Americans and threatens our freedom.

The other vision finds its roots in the spirit of our founding revolution and in the leaders of this nation who embraced the age of reason. It loves freedom, encourages ersity, embraces science and affirms the dignity and rights of every inidual. It sees America as a moral nation, neither completely religious nor completely secular. It defines patriotism as love of country and of the people who make it strong. It defends all citizens against unjust coercion and irrational conformity.

This second vision is our vision. It is the vision of a free society. We must be bold enough to proclaim it and strong enough to defend it against all its enemies.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Robert F. Kennedy<blockquote>

Man, however, is more than the fulfillment of the earth; he is reasonable, and reason is free and nothing but an eternal self-determination toward the infinite. Thus man can sacrifice only himself, and that is what he does in the omnipresent sanctissimum of which the masses are not aware. All artists are self-sacrificing human beings, and to become an artist is nothing but to devote oneself to the subterranean gods. The meaning of ine creation is primarily revealed in the enthusiasm of annihilation.

Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy (science); for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and disgested.

        The common dogma [of fundamentalists] is fear of modern knowledge, inability to cope with the fast change in a scientific-technological society, and the real breakdown in apparent moral order in recent years.... That is why hate is the major fuel, fear is the cement of the movement, and superstitious ignorance is the best defense against the dangerous new knowledge. ... When you bring up arguments that cast serious doubts on their cherished beliefs you are not simply making a rhetorical point, you are threatening their whole Universe and their immortality. That provokes anger and quite frequently violence. ... Unfortunately you cannot reason with them and you even risk violence in confronting them.

I believe that it is better to be free than to be not free, even when the former is dangerous and the latter safe.  I believe that the finest qualities of man can flourish only in free air – that progress made under the shadow of the policeman's club is false progress, and of no permanent value.

When I rise it will be with the ranks, and not from the ranks.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Frederick Buechner<blockquote>

        Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its many waters. The struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, or it may be both. But it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Joe Hill<blockquote>

If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence.

        To understand reality is not the same as to know about outward events. It is to perceive the essential nature of things. The best-informed man is not necessarily the wisest. Indeed there is a danger that precisely in the multiplicity of his knowledge he will lose sight of what is essential. But on the other hand, knowledge of an apparently trivial detail quite often makes it possible to see into the depth of things. And so the wise man will seek to acquire the best possible knowledge about events, but always without becoming dependent upon this knowledge. To recognize the significant in the factual is wisdom.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Doc Childre and Deborah Rozman<blockquote>

        What work I have done I have done because it has been play. If it had been work I shouldn't have done it. Who was it who said, "Blessed is the man who has found his work"? Whoever it was he had the right idea in his mind. Mark you, he says his work--not somebody else's work. The work that is really a man's own work is play and not work at all. Cursed is the man who has found some other man's work and cannot lose it. When we talk about the great workers of the world we really mean the great players of the world. The fellows who groan and sweat under the weary load of toil that they bear never can hope to do anything great. How can they when their souls are in a ferment of revolt against the employment of their hands and brains? The product of slavery, intellectual or physical, can never be great.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Orson Scott Card<blockquote>

This will be the day when we bring into full realization the American dream -- a dream yet unfulfilled. A dream of equality of opportunity, of privilege and property widely distributed; a dream of a land where men will not take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few; a dream of a land where men will not argue that the color of a man's skin determines the content of his character; a dream of a nation where all our gifts and resources are held not for ourselves alone, but as instruments of service for the rest of humanity; the dream of a country where every man will respect the dignity and worth of the human personality.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Mohandas K.

        There are some books that refuse to be written. They stand their ground year after year and will not be persuaded. It isn't because the book is not there and worth being written -- it is only because the right form of the story does not present itself. There is only one right form for a story and if you fail to find that form the story will not tell itself.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Mark Twain<blockquote>
        I notice that you use plain, simple language, short words and brief sentences. That is the way to write English - it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; don't let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in. When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them - then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when they are close together. They give strength when they are wide apart. An adjective habit, or a wordy, diffuse, flowery habit, once fastened upon a person, is as hard to get rid of as any other vice.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Mark Twain<blockquote>
        To get the right word in the right place is a rare achievement. To condense the diffused light of a page of thought into the luminous flash of a single sentence, is worthy to rank as a prize composition just by itself...Anybody can have ideas--the difficulty is to express them without squandering a quire of paper on an idea that ought to be reduced to one glittering paragraph.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Oscar Wilde<blockquote>

        When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man who had a mother, then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet. . . indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>Willa Cather<blockquote>
        Writing ought either to be the manufacture of stories for which there is a market demand -- a business as safe and commendable as making soap or breakfast foods -- or it should be an art, which is always a search for something for which there is no market demand, something new and untried, where the values are intrinsic and have nothing to do with standardized values.</blockquote><##QUOTE##>William Wordsworth<blockquote>
